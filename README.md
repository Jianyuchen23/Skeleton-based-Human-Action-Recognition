# Skeleton-based-Human-Action-Recognition
This is partial implementation of PR 2017 and CVPR 2018 papers

First, download Northwestern-UCLA dataset and NTU RGB+D dataset from here.
Only 3D skeletons are used for these methods.

Second, open Matlab and run "run.m" to extract feature for each sample.
