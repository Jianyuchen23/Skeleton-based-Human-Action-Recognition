# Skeleton-based-Human-Action-Recognition
This is partial implementation of PR 2017 and CVPR 2018 papers

Matlab R2015b, Python 2.7.14, and Pytorch 0.3.0 are used.

1. $ git clone https://github.com/nkliuyifang/Skeleton-based-Human-Action-Recognition.git

2. $ wget https://pan.baidu.com/s/1f7hWElp3_u5Wen8qVGfB8Q
   $ unzip Northwestern-UCLA_skeleton

Second, open Matlab and run "run.m" to extract feature for each sample.

Third, run "python run.py" for training and testing.

Finally, run "python show.py" to get final results.
